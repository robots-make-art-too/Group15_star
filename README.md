# Group15_star
Basic Introduction </br>
  When the QR code is scanned, the stars are embedded in the background, creating a background where you can see the stars together day or night. It was made for those who wanted to take pictures against the backdrop of stars. A function that could be added is that the user may able to see different sizes of stars depending on the users choices (such as medium or random). But this function is still in the part of planning. Taking pictures with stars seems almost impossible, but it is possible through technology in this way.
